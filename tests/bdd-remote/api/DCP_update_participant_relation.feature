# A gaining DCP must pre notify the losing DCP of the transition and submit the confirmation/acknowledgement with the update request to the DCL
# The existing relationship is not deleted, but rather end-dated.
# The update request can submit a future date time for the update to take effect so long as it is less that 30 days from the original notification to the existing DCP.
